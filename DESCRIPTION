Description: The game setup replicates the game on the TV show "Let's Make a Deal" where there are three doors for a contestant to choose from, one of which has a car behind it and two have goats. The contestant selects a door, then the host opens a door to reveal a goat, and then the contestant is given an opportunity to stay with their original selection or switch to the other unopened door. There was a famous debate about whether it was optimal to stay or switch when given the option to switch. This also includes a simulation to play game, n times, to see which strategy is best.
